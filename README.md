# TraindYourBrain - Game

## Serious game university project

### The game was created to help older people with dementia. The player's task is to press as quickly as possible on the coloured birds depending on the displayed colour in a certain field. In addition, to make the task more difficult, the caption displayed in the box may show the name of the colour incompatible with the generated colour of the box.
